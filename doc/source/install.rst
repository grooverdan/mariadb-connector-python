Installation
============

.. sectionauthor:: Georg Richter <georg@mariadb.com>

Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 3 (minimum supported version is 3.6)
- MariaDB Server (>= 10.2) or MySQL Server (>= 5.7)
- MariaDB Connector/C


Build prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following build prerequisites are required to install or build MariaDB Connector/Python.
For Windows operating platforms the pypi.org download page provides binary versions.

- C compiler
- Python development files (Usually they are installed with package **python-dev**). The minimum supported version of Python is 3.7
- MariaDB Connector/C libraries and header files (Either from MariaDB server package or
  from MariaDB Connector/C package). Minimum required version for |MCP| < 1.1.0 is 3.1.5, for later versions 3.2.4.
- For Posix systems: TLS libraries, e.g. GnuTLS or OpenSSL (default)

On Posix systems make sure that the path environment variable contains the directory which
contains the mariadb_config utility.

Once everything is in place, run

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install mariadb

or if you downloaded the source package

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install

Binary installation
-------------------
MariaDB Connector/Python is also available from PyPi as wheel packages for Windows.
Please note that dynamic MariaDB plugins (e.g. authentication plugins) are not part
of the package and must be installed separately by installing MariaDB Connector/C or
MariaDB Server package.

Make sure you have an up to date version of pip and install it with

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install mariadb

Test suite
----------
If you have installed the sources, after successful build you can run the test suite
from the source directory.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m unittest discover -v

You can configure the connection parameters by using the following environment variables

* TEST_USER (default root)
* TEST_PASSWORD
* TEST_DATABASE (default 'testp')
* TEST_HOST (default 'localhost')
* TEST_PORT (default 3306)
